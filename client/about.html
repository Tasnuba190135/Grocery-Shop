        <p class="title">Our Story</p>
        <p>grocery.com is an online shop available in Dhaka, Jashore and Chattogram. We believe the time is valuable to our fellow Dhaka residents, and that they should not have to waste hours in traffic, brave harsh weather, and wait in line just to buy necessities like eggs!  This is why we deliver everyday needs to our customers’ door-steps across urban cities. 

            grocery is a work in progress, and we hope to get better over time. We are firm believers in using technology and education to improve Bangladesh, and we will continue to invest all our effort in pushing the boundaries of technology.
            If you have ideas on how we can improve, we would love to hear from you. Please do email us at info@grocery.com.</p>
